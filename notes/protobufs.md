# protobufs
## 🎯 Core Concept

- [[adapter]] and [[serializer]]
- basicaly a fast and minimal form of data representation that is widely understood by programming languages
- micro-services and distributed systems use this data type in order to remain efficient

## 🔗 Connections & Context
**Relates to:** [[adapter]] [[serializer]] 

## 📝 Deep Processing Questions
1. **What would happen if this weren't true?**
  - alternative is [[json]] and will cause the servises to slow down considering the memory reqirements and size of json
2. **How do this change my thinking about JSON?**
  * json is slow when used inside of micro-services
  * Micro servises usually use protobufs
