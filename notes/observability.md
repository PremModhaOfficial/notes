# Observability
## 🎯 Core Concept #trait
### what does it mean be observable?
> [!NOTE] Definition
> A measure of how well can a system's internal status can be inferred
> from its external outputs


# Telemetry
> [!note] telemetry
>  Telemetry is the automated process of measuring and transmitting data from 
> remote or inaccessible sources to a central location for monitoring and analysis.
> #telemetry

> This data is typically collected using sensors and other devices and then transmitted via communication systems 
> to a central system for processing and interpretation.


> [!note] Definition (Personal)
> how well can you reason about the internal states of a system by using its telemetric outputs

### why it is needed?
- 'Mordern' software architechure is become wery complex and has need of central entity for oprations
- So you need to get the data in a central location to debug and damage control
- the Service is very complex set of layers whorking with each other and influencing the layers above
  1. Business logic
  2. Application Logic
  3. Runtime
  4. OS / Kernel
  5. Hardware

### Kinds Problems
- In solving A problem we need the information and there is [[problems-paradims|4 types of information]] 
  A. KK -> Server responds 500
  B. KU -> Disk writes
    - we dont know information on disk i/o no #telemetry
  C. UU -> we dont know what we dont know
