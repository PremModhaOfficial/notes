# What is PSI?

> [!faq] Definition
> Pressure Stall Information (PSI) is a Linux kernel feature that monitors resource contention
> when tasks are ready to run but can't proceed because of a lack of some resource (CPU, memory, or I/O).
> ---
> It doesn’t just say "CPU is 90% used" — it says "Processes are waiting and stalling because they're not getting CPU time."
> It's qualitative, not just quantitative.

## WHY
- cpu/memory/io usage doesn't tell you full the story
- prosses may be waiting on thoes resources

## 🔧 Application & Use Cases
**Immediate applications:**
- 
### case 1
- lets say cpu consumption is 50%
- But your pc is slow
- your Application is waiting on something that is not being freed, despite having cpu you cannot operate
- **psi will show you hoe much time all the services combined did the variouse service stalled for resource**

### case 2
- you cpu utilozation is 100% but 
- your stall time is 0 than that is okay because ther are no problems in performace due to that
