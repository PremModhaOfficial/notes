# traces
## 🎯 Core Concept
## what is it
- The method of tracking how a singular request travels througth the distributed / micro-services arcitechure and what happens to it along the way 
- the act of tracing every request and how it mutates and collects data througthout its lifetime in a complex distributed system

## Example like I am 5

> [!Example] Traveling Package
> Suppose you ordered something in post and it arreves througth a complex network of post offices 
> If you fail to get the Package you have to find-out where is the package stuck
> Telemetry-Trace is like a package tracking system which shows you wher you package has arrived, is stuck, missing etc
> ---
> Just Like that Tracing in computer science refers to the system that track a users request as it travels,
> Through a complex web ob micro-services / distributed sytem archi

## The Problem
![[knowladge-ecom-structure.png]]

- the cart page is broken... some thing has gone wrong 500
- or 5% of users having some problem and you as a developer are not part of that 5%

## History
- it was first done at google then twiter and at the present became a standard protocol called `open-telemetry`
- languages has implemented open-telemetry standards

## What we want out of it?? Things we want to know
### State Transitions (NOT THIS)
- Application Lifecycle events
  * simple is application Started or Ended
### prosses Execution (PRIMARILY THIS)
- Prosses is waiting on something completed this way / stopped that way etc
