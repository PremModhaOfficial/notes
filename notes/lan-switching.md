# Lan-Switching
## 🎯 Core Concept
- Address Resulution Protocol
- Used to Discover the layer 2 address [[mac-addresses]] of the known layer 3 address [[ip-address]] 

## Consists of two messages:
    - We broadcast the request because we dont know the address
    - We get the [[broadcast-patterns#Unicast|Unicast]] response
    -  ARP request
    -  ARP response
