# What
- 0s and 1s
- Speed is measured in bits not bytes


# RJ45 cables
## Utp cables
- Unprotected twisted pair cables

## transmission of data in switch, routers and pcs
- PC = Routers = firewalls = -switch (switches are opposite of the routers and PCs)
  - send data from 1,2
  - receive data from 3,6

- But we a Problem what if we want to connect two pcs or any combination of two same interfaces?
- WE use crossover cable which reverses the configuration

### Auto MDI-X
- The newer switches and devises are smart enough to flip the reciever and transmission end by detecting the connected device so we don't have to worry about the cable being straight-through
